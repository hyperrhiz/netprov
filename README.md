# netprov
Twitter reading scripts


## Demo

To get the data, search for the hashtag you want on Twitter. 
You have to scroll all the way through in order to get all the tweets.
Save the page as html and then run the script to create a csv.

E.g. reads from  `./sootfall.html` and writes to `./sootfall.csv`.

```
python netprov.py sootfall
```

For example of output (pretty printed in HTML), see http://www.hyperrhiz.net/hyperrhiz11/archives/sootfall.php.
